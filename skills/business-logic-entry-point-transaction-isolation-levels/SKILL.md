description: Set transaction isolation levels for business-logic entry points when Command-Query Separation and database transactions are both in use. Use when an agent needs to create, modify, review, or interpret the isolation level of a database transaction at a business-logic entry point that follows CQS. Query handlers must use the least blocking isolation level available in the project's database. Command handlers must use REPEATABLE READ isolation level.

# Transaction Isolation Levels for Business Logic Entry Points

## Goal

When a business-logic entry point wraps its flow in a database transaction and follows Command-Query Separation, set the transaction isolation level based on whether the entry point is a command handler or a query handler.

- Query handlers use the least blocking isolation level available in the project's database.
- Command handlers use REPEATABLE READ.

## When This Skill Applies

This skill activates only when all three conditions are met:

1. The entry point is a business-logic entry point.
2. The entry point wraps its flow in a database transaction.
3. The entry point follows Command-Query Separation, so it is classified as either a command handler or a query handler.

If any of these conditions is not met, this skill does not apply.

## The Rule

1. Query handlers must use the least blocking isolation level available.
   - Use READ UNCOMMITTED if the database supports it.
   - If READ UNCOMMITTED is not available, use READ COMMITTED.
   - If neither is available, use the lowest isolation level the database provides.
   - The goal is to minimize locking and contention for read-only operations.

2. Command handlers must use REPEATABLE READ.
   - Set the isolation level to REPEATABLE READ explicitly.
   - This ensures that data read during business constraints and business decisions remains stable throughout the transaction, preventing non-repeatable reads between the constraint checks and the state changes.

3. Set the isolation level when opening the transaction.
   - Use the project's library, framework, or ORM to specify the isolation level at transaction creation time.
   - Do not change the isolation level mid-transaction.

4. Follow the database's naming conventions for isolation levels.
   - Use the exact isolation level name or constant that the project's database and library expect.
   - Map the conceptual levels (READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ) to the project's specific syntax.

## Examples

TypeScript with a transaction wrapper:

```ts
// Query handler — least blocking isolation level
const findReservationByIdQueryHandler = (
  query: FindReservationByIdQuery,
): ResultAsync<FindReservationByIdQueryHandlerSuccess, FindReservationByIdQueryHandlerError> => {
  return withTransaction({ isolationLevel: 'READ UNCOMMITTED' }, (transaction) =>
    ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(query.requesterId)
      .andThen((requesterId) =>
        findReservationById(transaction, query.reservationId)
      )
  )
}

// Command handler — REPEATABLE READ
const createReservationCommandHandler = (
  command: CreateReservationCommand,
): ResultAsync<CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess, CreateReservationCommandHandlerError> => {
  return withTransaction({ isolationLevel: 'REPEATABLE READ' }, (transaction) =>
    ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(command.requesterId)
      .andThen((requesterId) =>
        ensureAvailableCars(transaction, command.carClass)
      )
      .andThen(() =>
        persistReservation(transaction, reservation)
      )
  )
}
```

Python with a context manager:

```py
# Query handler — least blocking isolation level
def find_reservation_by_id_query_handler(
    query: FindReservationByIdQuery,
) -> FindReservationByIdQueryHandlerSuccess:
    with transaction(isolation_level="READ UNCOMMITTED") as tx:
        requester_id = ensure_requester_is_authenticated(query.requester_id)
        return find_reservation_by_id(tx, query.reservation_id)

# Command handler — REPEATABLE READ
def create_reservation_command_handler(
    command: CreateReservationCommand,
) -> CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess:
    with transaction(isolation_level="REPEATABLE READ") as tx:
        requester_id = ensure_requester_is_authenticated(command.requester_id)
        ensure_available_cars(tx, command.car_class)
        return persist_reservation(tx, reservation)
```

Kotlin with a framework transaction:

```kt
// Query handler — least blocking isolation level
fun findReservationByIdQueryHandler(
    query: FindReservationByIdQuery,
): FindReservationByIdQueryHandlerSuccess {
    return withTransaction(isolationLevel = IsolationLevel.READ_UNCOMMITTED) { tx ->
        val requesterId = ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(query.requesterId)
        findReservationById(tx, query.reservationId)
    }
}

// Command handler — REPEATABLE READ
fun createReservationCommandHandler(
    command: CreateReservationCommand,
): CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess {
    return withTransaction(isolationLevel = IsolationLevel.REPEATABLE_READ) { tx ->
        val requesterId = ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(command.requesterId)
        ensureAvailableCars(tx, command.carClass)
        persistReservation(tx, reservation)
    }
}
```

## Detection Workflow

1. Confirm all three activation conditions.
   - The entry point is a business-logic entry point.
   - It wraps its flow in a database transaction.
   - It follows Command-Query Separation.

2. Classify the entry point as a command handler or a query handler.
   - Use the CQS classification from the project or from the CQS skill.

3. Check the current isolation level.
   - Verify that query handlers use the least blocking level available.
   - Verify that command handlers use REPEATABLE READ.

4. Check that the isolation level is set at transaction creation time.
   - Verify that it is not changed mid-transaction.
   - Verify that the project's library or ORM syntax is used correctly.

## Writing or Changing Entry Points

1. Determine the CQS role first.
   - Classify the entry point as a command handler or a query handler.

2. Set the isolation level accordingly.
   - Query handler: use the least blocking isolation level the database supports.
   - Command handler: use REPEATABLE READ.

3. Specify the isolation level at transaction creation.
   - Use the project's idiomatic way to set isolation levels.
   - Do not rely on database-level defaults unless they match the required level.

## Review Questions

When reading or reviewing code, ask:

- Is this entry point a command handler or a query handler under CQS?
- Does it wrap its flow in a database transaction?
- Is the isolation level set explicitly at transaction creation time?
- Does a query handler use the least blocking isolation level available?
- Does a command handler use REPEATABLE READ?

If the answer is yes, apply this skill.

## Report the Outcome

When finishing the task:

- state which entry points were identified or changed
- state whether each is a command handler or a query handler
- state which isolation level was set for each
- state which database and transaction mechanism were used
